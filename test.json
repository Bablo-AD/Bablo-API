It's great that you have a variety of habits that promote physical and mental health, such as exercising, getting sunlight, and journaling. However, I noticed that you mentioned relapsing and struggling with productivity. It's important to remember that setbacks happen, but it's crucial to learn from them and move forward. \n\nOne suggestion I have is to create a more structured schedule for yourself, with specific times for work, exercise, and relaxation. This can help you stay focused and avoid distractions. Additionally, it may be helpful to identify triggers that lead to relapses and find ways to avoid or cope with them. \n\nOverall, keep up the good work with your positive habits and continue to strive towards your goals. Remember to be kind to yourself and celebrate your successes along the way."}
